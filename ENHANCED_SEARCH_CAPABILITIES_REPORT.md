- **Typos and abbreviations** (apartmnt, nyc, ppl)

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. OpenRouter Service Improvements**
```python
# Enhanced system prompt for better parameter extraction
- location: string (city, state, neighborhood, or area - be specific)
- bedrooms: number (exact number if specified, even if 10+)
- guests: number (total capacity needed)
- property_type: string (house, apartment, villa, mansion, estate, cabin, etc.)
- amenities: array of strings (pool, hot tub, wifi, kitchen, etc.)
- special_requirements: array (large group, wedding, reunion, etc.)

# IMPORTANT: For large properties (5+ bedrooms), estimate guest capacity as bedrooms × 2.
# Handle specific numbers even beyond typical Airbnb limits (11 bedrooms = 22+ guests).
```

### **2. Enhanced Fallback Processing**
```python
# Location detection with aliases and abbreviations
location_map = {
    'sf': 'San Francisco',
    'nyc': 'New York', 
    'la': 'Los Angeles',
    'texas': 'Texas',
    'napa': 'Napa Valley',
    'hamptons': 'The Hamptons',
    # ... 20+ location mappings
}

# Enhanced number extraction (including written numbers)
number_words = {
    'eleven': 11, 'twelve': 12, 'thirteen': 13,
    'fourteen': 14, 'fifteen': 15, 'twenty': 20
    # ... complete number word mapping
}

# Property type detection
property_types = {
    'house': 'house', 'villa': 'villa', 'mansion': 'mansion',
    'estate': 'estate', 'cabin': 'cabin', 'cottage': 'cottage'
}
```
