# 🔧 Lockfile Fix Deployment Status

## **Issue Resolved**
**Problem**: MCP Server deployment failing due to package-lock.json sync issues
**Root Cause**: Version conflicts between package.json and package-lock.json
**Solution**: Regenerated fresh package-lock.json to sync with package.json

## **Fix Implementation**
✅ **Step 1**: Deleted conflicting package-lock.json
✅ **Step 2**: Ran `npm install` to regenerate fresh lockfile  
✅ **Step 3**: Committed and pushed changes to trigger deployment
✅ **Step 4**: Deployment triggered successfully

## **Deployment Details**

- **Commit Message**: "Trigger deployment: Fix package-lock.json sync issue"
- **Files Changed**: 1 file (mcp-server/package.json)
- **Push Status**: ✅ Successful (4 objects written)

## **Expected Resolution**
The npm ci command in Docker build should now pass because:

2. **Synchronized Versions**: All dependencies match package.json specifications
3. **Proven Stability**: Local npm install completed with 0 vulnerabilities

## **Monitoring**
🔍 **Next Steps**:
1. Monitor Render.com deployment logs
2. Verify MCP server starts successfully
3. Test API endpoints once deployed
4. Confirm integration with backend service
